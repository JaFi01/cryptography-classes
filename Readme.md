# Encryption and Decryption

## Project Description
This project contains implementations of encryption and decryption algorithms, including the Caesar cipher and the Vigenère cipher where encrypting word is <=3 charracter long.

## How to Use
### 1. Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

### 2. Running
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
- Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the command `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

#### 2.1 Running specific files

- To see how specific file work run comand `python caesar_automatic_decryptor.py`
- don't forget to modify the code before calling the functions

### 3. Choosing an Algorithm
Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed allowing you to choose the encryption or decryption algorithm (Caesar or Vigenère).

### 4. Inputting Data
You will then be prompted to input the encrypted sentence.

### 5. Displaying the Result
After inputting the encrypted sentence, the program will decrypt it and display the result.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Nltk
